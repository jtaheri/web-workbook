      <!-- theme song for Hey Arthur -->
      <p>
        Everyday when you're walking down the street, everybody that you meet
        Has an original point of view
        And I say HEY! what a wonderful kind of day.
        Where you can learn to work and play
        And get along with each other

        You got to listen to your heart
        Listen to the beat
        Listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street
        Open up your eyes, open up your ears
        Get together and make things better by working together
        It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
        Believe in youself (echo: believe in yourself)
        Well thats the place to start (to start)

        And I say HEY! what a wonderful kind of day
        Where you learn to work and play
        And get along with each other
      </p>
